About

Welcome to my project! This front-end project is designed to showcase press articles, enabling users to interact with and explore a curated list of articles. The project features a home page, article listing with sorting options, article viewing and liking functionality, commenting capabilities, and article filtering by topic.


Features


Home Page

Upon entering the application, users are greeted with a welcoming home page that provides an overview of the project.

Article Listing

The project displays a comprehensive list of press articles sourced from the back-end API created by me(https://github.com/darvatu/Personal-Project.git and hosted online at: https://daniel-app.onrender.com/api/ ). Users can easily navigate through the articles and explore the content.

Sorting

Articles can be sorted in ascending or descending order based on the following criteria:
    Date created
    Comment count
    Votes

Article Interaction

Users have the ability to view and like each article, enabling them to express their interest and appreciation for the content.

Comments

Each article displays associated comments, allowing users to engage in discussions and share their thoughts. By default, only the author can add new comments to articles and delete their own comments as needed.

Filtering

The project provides a convenient filtering mechanism that allows users to narrow down articles based on specific topics of interest.
